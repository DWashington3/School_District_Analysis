# School Distrist Analysis with Jupyter
## Overview
Maria works for the city school district, and she’s tasked me with analyzing the data of schools in the district. I analyzed the schools’ size, passing percentage, and spending per capita. 
### Preprocessing
After the initial school district analysis, Maria informed me that academic dishonesty was compromised. Specifically, data for the ninth graders at Thomas High school. Consequently, this resulted in another school district analysis, where I cleaned the data by getting rid of the Thomas Highschool ninth grade reading and math scores and replacing them with “NaN”. This enabled me to maintain the integrity of the remaining data.
